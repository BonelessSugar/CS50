Plurality.c

In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, 
whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

ranked choice voting with runoff election

The candidate who received the fewest number of votes is eliminated from the election, 
and anyone who originally chose that candidate as their first preference now has their second preference considered.

In a plurality vote where each voter chooses their first preference only, Charlie wins this election with four votes compared to only three for Bob and two for Alice.
(Note that, if you’re familiar with the instant runoff voting system, Charlie wins here under that system as well). 
Alice, however, might reasonably make the argument that she should be the winner of the election instead of Charlie: 
after all, of the nine voters, a majority (five of them) preferred Alice over Charlie, so most people would be happier with Alice as the winner instead of Charlie.

Alice is, in this election, the so-called “Condorcet winner” of the election: 
the person who would have won any head-to-head matchup against another candidate. 
If the election had been just Alice and Bob, or just Alice and Charlie, Alice would have won.

The Tideman voting method (also known as “ranked pairs”) is a ranked-choice voting method that’s guaranteed to 
produce the Condorcet winner of the election if one exists.

Generally speaking, the Tideman method works by constructing a “graph” of candidates, where an arrow 
(i.e. edge) from candidate A to candidate B indicates that candidate A wins against candidate B in a head-to-head matchup.
